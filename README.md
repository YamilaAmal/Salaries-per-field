# Salaries-per-field

This project explores the relationship between work experience, career type, gender, and salaries.

The results suggest that more technical careers tend to require more experience to earn higher salaries, while careers related to Arts show salaries that do not seem to depend heavily on experience.

Furthermore, we found no sufficient evidence to claim significant salary differences based on gender in any field analyzed. However, it is observed that the number of men is higher in areas like Engineering and Law.
